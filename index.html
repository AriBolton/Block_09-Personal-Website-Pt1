      <p class="paragraphs">
        I love to create. If there is something I want to do, and can't find the best tool to assist, then I'm likely
        looking at ways to combine what's already out there to interact the way I'd like, or working on a way to create
        whatever it is that I'm looking for. I can't wait to have the knowledge to take the ideas that I have in my
        head, and put them into code, and eventually onto people's phones.
      </p>
      <h3 class="individual_headings">Connector</h3>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        I'm always looking for new ways to make connections, with and for people. If anyone ever needs a
        reccommendation, I will likely be one of the first to jump in and
        begin finding a resource in my connection pool. I'm also interested in finding new ways to help people reach
        their goals, both personally and professionally. If I can assist in any way at all... I will.
      </p>
      <h3 class="individual_headings">Nurturer</h3>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        Nurturing and building up the people around me is probably what brings me the most joy. I love to see others
        excel, and if I can assist in furthering their success in anyway, I will strive to find a way to do so.
