                    I have a large family, and a large number of friends. Often, I feel like I don't have enough time to
                    spend with all of the people I care about. When it comes to gifts- I would say that the best gift
                    anyone can give, is to spend quality time. I make sure I prioritize spending time wiht my sons on
                    the weeks when he's with me, and spending time with my friends and boyfriend on the weeks when my
                    son is with his dad.

                    My boyfriend and I are working on our new business. If I'm not working, or spending time with the
                    people I love, then I'm working on the business development. Learning code is part of that process.
                    I'm also researching desing platforms that will allow me to create the app I'm envisioning, that
                    will also allow me to more quickly export my design, and get it into code so that I can have a
                    viable product to release.

                    I have 2 dogs, and my sister who I live with also has 2 dogs. I love spending time with them, as
                    they're extended members of our family. My border collie mix, Skye, loves to go hiking with me, so
                    that's something we often enjoy doing on the weekends. My older pup, Vega, loves to snuggle. He'll
                    crawl up onto your lap anytime you're sitting on the couch and give you all of the cuddles.
