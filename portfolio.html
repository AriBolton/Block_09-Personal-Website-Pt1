        While I have yet to complete a website or mobile application, I do have many transferrable skills that I've
        learned over the years that I plan to apply in this next endeavor.

            <p>
                My first job after graduating college was as a project assistant for a construction company. I learned
                many valuable skills, including how to manage projects from beginning to end. I learned the importance
                of scheduling, and thorough documentation. I also got a lot of practice in prioritizing, and juggling
                multiple tasks with competing deadlines.

            <p style="margin-right: 20px;">
                After leaving the construction role, I went into Insurance for a bit. I learned many valuable skills
                there as well, including the importance of providing great customer service. As many of us know, it can
                be challenging when you're constantly dealing with people calling in who are upset with your product, or
                prices, etc. The more you interact with the customers, the easier it gets to manage their expectations,
                and to put them at ease with your knowledge, and ability to support them and make it right however
                possible.

            <p>
                My two roles prior to my current role of an exxecutive assistant, both prepared me for the job. While
                all of the jobs that I've had are different, they all have many things that overlap. As an executive
                assistant, I not only have to manage my own schedule and competing priorities, but also be sure that the
                schedules for all four leaders I support are in order. This role combines project management, customer
                service, and being an assistant all into one job. My goal on a daily basis is to manage priorities and
                schedules, and make sure that my customers (aka my bosses) are satisfied at the end of the day.
